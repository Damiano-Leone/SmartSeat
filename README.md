## SmartSeat
SmartSeat is an application designed to manage the reservation and usage of workstations in shared environments such as study rooms, corporate open spaces, and coworking areas.
It allows users to easily book a workstation, check in upon arrival using a QR code, and enables administrators to monitor real-time occupancy to optimize space management.
